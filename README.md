# HNG-STAGE-ZERO
Just a profile
# HNG Stage 0 ‚Äì Profile Card

This project is my submission for the **HNG Stage 0 Frontend Task**.  
It‚Äôs a simple profile card built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript**, hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

 üß± Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a **responsive profile card** that displays:
- My name  
- My Slack display name  
- My Slack email  
- My track (Frontend)  
- The current time in UTC  
- A link to my GitHub profile  

Everything is styled to look clean, balanced, and easy to read.


 üß© Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for layout and styling  
- **JavaScript** for showing the current UTC time dynamically
